However,  human studies investigating the evolution of such phenomena are limited. This  study investigated the levels of emerging biomarkers of endothelial function,  angiogenesis and hypoxia, in ADPKD patients with different renal function.  METHODS: The study population consisted of three groups: 26 ADPKD patients with  impaired renal function (Group A; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]  45-70 mL/min/1.73 m2), 26 ADPKD patients with preserved renal function (Group B;  eGFR >70 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 26 age- and sex-matched controls with no history of  renal disease.

This  presents significant patient anxiety and a significant prognostic and therapeutic  challenge. Tolvaptan is the only approved drug licensed to slow ADPKD progression  by reducing renal cystic expansion but side-effects can limit its efficacy. To  address the need to identify new biomarkers to monitor progression of ADPKD and  to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Tolvaptan, proteomic analysis was  conducted on defined (40-100nm) urinary exosomes isolated from ADPKD patients  phenotyped and clinically monitored over a 10-year period. Comparative Gene  Ontology analysis of Tandem Mass Tag labelled mass spectrometry-derived protein  profiles from urinary exosomes from ADPKD patients with rapid (>10ml/min/5 years  decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate) versus slow progression showed  distinctive patterns of pathway up-regulation. Clear discrimination between rapid  and slowly-progressive profiles were seen in all stages functional decline in  ADPKD patients whether with mild (>70ml/min), moderate (50-69ml/min) or severe  (<49ml/min) disease at onset. Discriminatory pathways and proteins included  Notch-, integrin- and growth factor-signalling; microtubular kinase, vesicular  proteins and epidermal growth factor substrates. Confocal microscopy of  fluorescently-labelled normal versus ADPKD epithelial cell-derived exosomes in  vitro also identified ADPKD-dependent abnormalities in intracellular vesicular  trafficking and implicated changes in ADPKD-dependent exosome secretion and  target cell uptake as factors underlying urinary exosome excretion biomarker  properties. Comparative proteomic analysis of urinary exosomal proteins in  individual patients before and after treatment with Tolvaptan for 4 years also  identified distinct patterns of pathway modification dependent on the degree of  effectiveness of the therapeutic response. Up-regulation of Wnt-pathway and  vesicular proteins were characteristic of urinary exosomes from ADPKD patients  with good responses to Tolvaptan while upregulation of angiogenesis pathways and  additional molecular forms of vasopressin receptor AVPR2 were characteristic in  urinary exosomes of ADPKD patients with poor responses. Taken together, these  studies conclude that proteomic profiling of urinary exosome biomarkers provides  a specific, sensitive and practical non-invasive method to identify and monitor  the rate of disease progression and the effects of Tolvaptan therapy in  individual ADPKD patients. This provides a means to identify those patients most  likely to benefit maximally from therapy and to progress towards a  personalization of ADPKD prognosis and management.",2021,2025-07-29 13:45:53,2025-07-29 13:45:53,,100013,,,1,,BBA Adv,,,,,,,,eng,© 2021 The Authors.

Conventional markers all have their limitations. Metabolic profiling is a  promising strategy for risk stratification. We determined the prognostic  performance to identify patients with a fast progressive disease course and  evaluated time-dependent changes in urinary metabolites. METHODS: Targeted,  quantitative metabolomics analysis (1H NMR-spectroscopy) was performed on spot  urinary samples at two time points, baseline (n = 324, 61% female; mean age 45  years, SD 11; median eGFR 61 mL/min/1.73 m2, IQR 42-88; mean years of creatinine  follow-up 3.7, SD 1.3) and a sample obtained after 3 years of follow-up (n =  112). Patients were stratified by their eGFR slope into fast and slow progressors  based on an annualized change of > -3.0 or ≤ -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year,  respectively.

Logistic regression was used to determine  prognostic performance in identifying those with a fast progressive course using  baseline urine samples. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze whether  changes in urinary metabolites over a 3-year follow-up period differed between  fast and slow progressors. RESULTS: In a single urinary sample, the prognostic  performance of urinary metabolites was comparable to that of a model including  height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV, AUC = 0.67). Combined with htTKV, the  predictive value of the metabolite model increased (AUC = 0.75).

METHODS: To identify candidate  urinary biomarkers of ADPKD progression, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to  generate porcine fibroblasts with mono- and biallelic ADPKD gene knockout  (PKD2+/- and PKD2-/-, respectively). We then performed RNA-sequencing analysis on  these cells. RESULTS: Levels of osteopontin (OPN), which is expressed by renal  epithelial tubular cells and excreted into urine, were reduced in PKD2-/- cells  but not in PKD2+/- cells. OPN levels were also reduced in the renal cyst cells of  ADPKD patients. Next, we investigated whether OPN excretion was decreased in  patients with ADPKD via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OPN levels excreted  into renal cyst cell culture media and urine from ADPKD patients were decreased.  To investigate whether OPN can predict the rate of ADPKD progression, we compared  urinary excretion of OPN in ADPKD patients with slow progression and those with  rapid progression.
