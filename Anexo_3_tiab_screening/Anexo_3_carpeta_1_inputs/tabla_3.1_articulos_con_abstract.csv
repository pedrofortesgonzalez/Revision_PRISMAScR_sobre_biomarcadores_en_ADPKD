It has  an incidence of 1 in 7000 worldwide making it one of the most common genetic  disorders in man. We phenotypically characterized a mouse model of cystinuria  type A resultant from knockout of Slc3a1. METHODS: Knockout of Slc3a1 at RNA and  protein levels was evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR and  immunofluorescence. Slc3a1 knockout mice were placed on normal or breeder chow  diets and evaluated for cystine stone formation over time suing x-ray analysis,  and the development of kidney injury by measuring injury biomarkers. Kidney  injury was also evaluated via histologic analysis. Amino acid levels were  measured in the blood of mice using high performance liquid chromatography. Liver  glutathione levels were measured using a luminescent-based assay. RESULTS: We  confirmed knockout of Slc3a1 at the RNA level, while Slc7a9 RNA representing the  co-transporter was preserved. As expected, we observed bladder stone formation in  Slc3a1(-/-) mice. Male Slc3a1(-/-) mice exhibited lower weights compared to  Slc3a1(+/+). Slc3a1(-/-) mice on a regular diet demonstrated elevated blood urea  nitrogen (BUN) without elevation of serum creatinine. However, placing the  knockout animals on a breeder chow diet, containing a higher cystine  concentration, resulted in the development of elevation of both BUN and  creatinine indicative of more severe chronic kidney disease. Histological  examination revealed that these dietary effects resulted in worsened kidney  tubular obstruction and interstitial inflammation as well as worsened bladder  inflammation. Cystine is a precursor for the antioxidant molecule glutathione, so  we evaluated glutathione levels in the livers of Slc3a1(-/-) mice. We found  significantly lowered levels of both reduced and total glutathione in the  knockout animals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that that diet can affect the  development and progression of chronic kidney disease in an animal model of  cystinuria, which may have important implications for patients with this disease.

In spite of the recent tremendous progress in the  understanding of ADPKD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of the disease  remain incompletely understood. Considering emerging new targeted therapies for  ADPKD, it has become crucial to disclose easily measurable and widely available  biomarkers for identifying patients with future rapid disease progression. This  review encompasses all the research with a shared goal of identifying promising  serum or urine biomarkers for predicting ADPKD progression or response to  therapy. The rate of the ADPKD progress varies significantly between patients.  The phenotypic variability is only partly explained by the underlying genetic  lesion diversity. Considering significant decline in kidney function in ADPKD is  not usually evident until at least 50% of the parenchyma has been destroyed,  conventional kidney function measures, such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR),  are not suitable for monitoring disease progression in ADPKD, particularly in its  early stages. Since polycystic kidney enlargement usually precedes the decline in  GFR, height-adjusted total kidney volume (ht-TKV) has been accepted as an early  biomarker for assessing disease severity in ADPKD patients.

This study  investigated urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) as a source of such  biomarkers. Proteomic analysis of uEVs identified matrix metalloproteinase 7  (MMP-7) as a biomarker predictive of rapid disease progression. In validation  studies, MMP-7 was predictive in uEVs but not in whole urine, possibly because  uEVs are primarily secreted by tubular epithelial cells. Indeed, single-nucleus  RNA sequencing showed that MMP-7 was especially increased in proximal tubule and  thick ascending limb cells, which were further characterized by a profibrotic  phenotype. Together, these data suggest that MMP-7 is a biologically plausible  and promising uEV biomarker for rapid disease progression in ADPKD. BACKGROUND:  In ADPKD, there is an unmet need for early markers of rapid disease progression  to facilitate counseling and selection for kidney-protective therapy. Our aim was  to identify markers for rapid disease progression in uEVs. METHODS: Six paired  case-control groups ( n =10-59/group) of cases with rapid disease progression and  controls with stable disease were formed from two independent ADPKD cohorts, with  matching by age, sex, total kidney volume, and genetic variant. Candidate uEV  biomarkers were identified by mass spectrometry and further analyzed using  immunoblotting and an ELISA. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of healthy and ADPKD  tissue was used to identify the cellular origin of the uEV biomarker. RESULTS: In  the discovery proteomics experiments, the protein abundance of MMP-7 was  significantly higher in uEVs of patients with rapid disease progression compared  with stable disease. In the validation groups, a significant >2-fold increase in  uEV-MMP-7 in patients with rapid disease progression was confirmed using  immunoblotting. By contrast, no significant difference in MMP-7 was found in  whole urine using ELISA.

Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are common aetiologies for  CKD, but IgA glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis  and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are also common causes of CKD.  MAIN BODY: Conventional biomarkers for CKD involving the use of estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from four variables (serum creatinine,  age, gender and ethnicity) are recommended by clinical guidelines for the  evaluation, classification, and stratification of CKD. However, these clinical  biomarkers present some limitations, especially for early stages of CKD, elderly  individuals, extreme body mass index values (serum creatinine), or are influenced  by inflammation, steroid treatment and thyroid dysfunction (serum cystatin C).  There is therefore a need to identify additional non-invasive biomarkers that are  useful in clinical practice to help improve CKD diagnosis, inform prognosis and  guide therapeutic management.

SLC13A5 inhibition has been proposed as a target for reducing  progression of kidney disease. The aim of this study was to leverage the  Mendelian randomization paradigm to gain insight into the effects of SLC13A5  inhibition in humans, towards prioritizing and informing clinical development  efforts. METHODS: The primary Mendelian randomization analyses investigated the  effect of SLC13A5 inhibition on measures of kidney function, including creatinine  and cystatin C-based measures of estimated glomerular filtration rate  (creatinine-eGFR and cystatin C-eGFR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine  albumin-creatinine ratio (uACR), and risk of chronic kidney disease and  microalbuminuria. Secondary analyses included a paired plasma and urine  metabolome-wide association study, investigation of secondary traits related to  SLC13A5 biology, a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), and a proteome-wide  association study. All analyses were compared to the effect of genetically  predicted plasma citrate levels using variants selected from across the genome,  and statistical sensitivity analyses robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic  variants were also performed. Data were obtained from large-scale genetic  consortia and biobanks, with sample sizes ranging from 5023 to 1,320,016  individuals. RESULTS: We found evidence of associations between genetically  proxied SLC13A5 inhibition and higher creatinine-eGFR (p = 0.002), cystatin  C-eGFR (p = 0.005), and lower BUN (p = 3 × 10(-4)). Statistical sensitivity  analyses robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants suggested that these  effects may be a consequence of higher plasma citrate levels. There was no strong  evidence of associations of genetically proxied SLC13A5 inhibition with uACR or  risk of CKD or microalbuminuria. Secondary analyses identified evidence of  associations with higher plasma calcium levels (p = 6 × 10(-13)) and lower  fasting glucose (p = 0.02). PheWAS did not identify any safety concerns.  CONCLUSIONS: This Mendelian randomization analysis provides human-centric insight  to guide clinical development of an SLC13A5 inhibitor.

Despite extensive research in this field, there are  no reliable genetics or other biomarkers to estimate the phenotypic consequences.  Therefore, CyKD in children heavily relies on clinical and diagnostic testing to  predict the long-term outcomes. AIM: A retrospective study aimed to provide a  concise overview of this condition and analyze real-life data from a  single-center pediatric CyKD cohort followed during a 12-year period. METHODS AND  MATERIALS: Medical records were reviewed for extensive clinical, laboratory, and  radiological data, treatment approaches, and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: During  the study period, 112 patients received a diagnosis of pediatric CyKD. Male  patients were more involved than female (1:0.93). Fifty-six patients had a  multicystic dysplastic kidney; twenty-one of them had an autosomal dominant  disorder; fifteen had an isolated renal cyst; ten had been diagnosed with  autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease; three had the tuberous sclerosis  complex; two patients each had Bardet-Biedl, Joubert syndrome, and  nephronophthisis; and one had been diagnosed with the trisomy 13 condition.  Genetic testing was performed in 17.9% of the patients, revealing disease-causing  mutations in three-quarters (75.0%) of the tested patients. The most commonly  presenting symptoms were abdominal distension (21.4%), abdominal pain (15.2%),  and oligohydramnios (12.5%). Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) were  documented in one-quarter of the patients, while 20.5% of them developed  hypertension during the long-term follow-up.

Elucidating the metabolic  characteristics of SHPT may provide a new theoretical basis for its prevention  and treatment. This study aimed to perform a metabolomic analysis of SHPT in  patients with CKD stages 3-5 not receiving dialysis. METHODS: A total of 76  patients with CKD, 85 patients with CKD-SHPT, and 67 healthy controls were  enrolled in this study. CKD was diagnosed according to the criteria specified in  the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines. SHPT was diagnosed  by experienced clinicians according to the Renal Disease Outcomes Quality  Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines. Serum renal function markers and the  lipid profile were analyzed. Untargeted ultra performance liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the serum metabolites  of patients with CKD and SHPT. Multivariate analysis of the data was performed  using principal component analysis and partial least square discriminant  analysis. Serum differential metabolites were identified and further  characterized using databases. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using  the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. Correlations between  differential metabolites and clinical parameters were determined using the  Spearman correlation. RESULTS: The serum metabolomic profiles of patients with  CKD with and without SHPT differed significantly. Differential metabolites were  mainly enriched in the top four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways:  phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis; sphingolipid metabolism;  glycerophospholipid metabolism; and phenylalanine metabolism. In total, 31  differential metabolites were identified; of these, L-tryptophan and  (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine were decreased, while other amino acids and their  derivatives, uremia toxins, carnitine, and lipids, were increased significantly  in patients with SHPT compared to those without. The 14 lipid metabolites were  positively correlated with levels of Urea, serum creatinine, cystatin C, and  triglycerides and negatively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration  rate and levels of total and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Tumour size ranged from 2.8 to 15.2 cm (median,  5.2 cm). Immunohistochemistry revealed consistently strong TFE3 expression in all  tumours, whereas PAX8 and keratin cocktails were uniformly negative. Other  positive markers included HMB45 (7/9 tumours), CathepsinK (7/9 tumours), and  CD117 (KIT) (3/5 tumours).

Urinary biomarkers may be useful for predicting the variable course of  ADPKD progression from cyst growth to ESRD. METHODS: To identify candidate  urinary biomarkers of ADPKD progression, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to  generate porcine fibroblasts with mono- and biallelic ADPKD gene knockout  (PKD2+/- and PKD2-/-, respectively). We then performed RNA-sequencing analysis on  these cells. RESULTS: Levels of osteopontin (OPN), which is expressed by renal  epithelial tubular cells and excreted into urine, were reduced in PKD2-/- cells  but not in PKD2+/- cells. OPN levels were also reduced in the renal cyst cells of  ADPKD patients. Next, we investigated whether OPN excretion was decreased in  patients with ADPKD via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OPN levels excreted  into renal cyst cell culture media and urine from ADPKD patients were decreased.

After  adjusting for age, gender, and BMI, MCP-1 and TNFR-2 levels were significantly  lower in Fabry patients than in CKD patients.

However, results at odds were often  noted from such independent association studies. This study proposes a genome  wide analysis approach to predict ESRD risk associated genes. METHODS: We  included 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing association among  north Indian ESRD cases and controls. ESRD cases comprised chronic  glomerulonephritis (CGN), chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN), hypertension  (HTN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Genotyping data  obtained from our prior published reports were compared with Genome-Wide  Association Studies (GWAS) SNPs retrieved from HapMap and GWASCentral databases  using R-statistical package SNPAssoc. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), gene-gene  interaction, classification and regression tree (CART) and pathway analysis were  carried out in the present study supplemented with IL-6 and TNF-α levels  estimation using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Comparison  of genotyping data with GWAS SNPs revealed significant associations for  interleukin (IL)1-RN, IL-6, MTHFR, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and CCR3  genes with ESRD. Nine SNPs were commonly associated with CGN, CIN, HTN, ADPKD and  ESRD. LD (D = 0.9) and gene-gene interaction (P = 0.0002) analyses revealed  significant associations for IL-6 and TNF-α genes. In a consistent manner, CART  analysis and functional analysis servers predict predisposing effects for TNF-α  and IL-6 with ESRD. Finally, higher body circulating levels were observed for  mutant TNF-α and IL-6 alleles among ESRD. CONCLUSION: The study indicates  significance for IL-6 and TNF-α gene with basic kidney diseases and ESRD.  Extensive statistical tests, pathway analysis and functional assays also reflect  attenuated level of significance for these SNPs.

However, data are  lacking regarding the prevalence of monogenic etiologies especially among members  of minority groups. This study characterized the genetic markers among members of  an Israeli minority group with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). STUDY DESIGN: A  national-multicenter cross-sectional study of Israeli Druze patients (an  Arabic-speaking Near-Eastern transnational population isolate) who are receiving  maintenance dialysis for ESKD. All study participants underwent exome sequencing.  SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 94 adults with ESKD, comprising 97% of the  total 97 Druze individuals throughout Israel being treated with dialysis during  the study period. PREDICTORS: Demographics and clinical characteristics of kidney  disease. OUTCOME: Genetic markers. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Whole-exome sequencing  and the relationship of markers to clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: We identified  genetic etiologies in 17 of 94 participants (18%). None had a previous molecular  diagnosis. A novel, population-specific, WDR19 homozygous pathogenic variant  (p.Cys293Tyr) was the most common genetic finding.

This study  aimed to identify disease-associated proteins in urinary extracellular vesicles  (uEVs), which include exosomes, in patients with ADPKD. We performed quantitative  proteomics on uEVs from healthy controls and patients with ADPKD using a labeled  approach and then used a label-free approach with uEVs of different subjects  (healthy controls versus patients with ADPKD versus patients with non-ADPKD CKD).  In both experiments, 30 proteins were consistently more abundant (by two-fold or  greater) in ADPKD-uEVs than in healthy- and CKD-uEVs. Of these proteins, we  selected periplakin, envoplakin, villin-1, and complement C3 and C9 for  confirmation because they were also significantly overrepresented in pathway  analysis and were previously implicated in ADPKD pathogenesis. Immunoblotting  confirmed higher abundances of the selected proteins in uEVs from three  independent groups of patients with ADPKD. Whereas uEVs of young patients with  ADPKD and preserved kidney function already had higher levels of complement, only  uEVs of patients with advanced stages of ADPKD had increased levels of villin-1,  periplakin, and envoplakin. Furthermore, all five proteins correlated positively  with total kidney volume.

However, researchers  and clinicians have recognized limitations of relying on creatinine as the only  filtration marker, which can lead to inaccurate GFR estimates in certain  populations due to the influence of non-GFR determinants of serum or plasma  creatinine. Therefore, recent literature has proposed incorporation of multiple  serum or plasma filtration markers into GFR estimation to improve precision and  accuracy and decrease the impact of non-GFR determinants for any individual  biomarker. To this end, the CKD-EPI combined creatinine-cystatin C equation  (eGFR(cr-cys)) was developed in 2012 and demonstrated superior accuracy to  equations relying on creatinine or cystatin C alone (eGFR(cr) or eGFR(cys)).

Two reviewers  independently selected the articles in which the accuracy of prenatal imaging  findings and fetal urinary analytes were evaluated to predict postnatal renal  function. Results: Out of the 727 articles analyzed, 20 met the selection  criteria, including 1049 fetuses. Regarding fetal imaging findings, the  predictive value of the amniotic fluid was investigated by 15 articles, the renal  appearance by 11, bladder findings by 4, and ureteral dilatation by 2. The  postnatal renal function showed a statistically significant relationship with the  occurrence of oligo- or anhydramnion in four studies, with an abnormal  echogenic/cystic renal cortical appearance in three studies. Single articles  proved the statistical prognostic value of the amniotic fluid index, the renal  parenchymal area, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured on fetal  diffusion-weighted MRI, and the lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) stage  (based on bladder volume at referral and gestational age at the appearance of  oligo- or anhydramnios). Regarding the predictive value of fetal urinary  analytes, sodium and β2-microglobulin were the two most common urinary analytes  investigated (n = 10 articles), followed by calcium (n = 6), chloride (n = 5),  urinary osmolarity (n = 4), and total protein (n = 3). Phosphorus, glucose,  creatinine, and urea were analyzed by two articles, and ammonium, potassium,  N-Acetyl-l3-D-glucosaminidase, and microalbumin were investigated by one article.  The majority of the studies (n = 8) failed to prove the prognostic value of fetal  urinary analytes.

The process of  apicobasal polarization in animal cells is controlled by the evolutionarily  conserved Crumbs (CRB), Partitioning-defective, and Scribble protein complexes.  Here, we investigated the role of protein associated with LIN-7 1 (Pals1, also  known as Mpp5), a core component of the apical membrane-determining CRB complex  in the nephron. Pals1 interacting proteins, including Crb3 and Wwtr1/Taz, have  been linked to renal cyst formation in mice before. Immunohistologic analysis  revealed Pals1 expression in renal tubular cells and podocytes of human kidneys.  Mice lacking one Pals1 allele (functionally haploid for Pals1) in nephrons  developed a fully penetrant phenotype, characterized by cyst formation and severe  defects in renal barrier function, which led to death within 6-8 weeks. In  Drosophila nephrocytes, deficiency of the Pals1 ortholog caused alterations in  slit-diaphragm-like structures. Additional studies in epithelial cell culture  models revealed that Pals1 functions as a dose-dependent upstream regulator of  the crosstalk between Hippo- and TGF-β-mediated signaling.

Tolvaptan is the only approved drug licensed to slow ADPKD progression  by reducing renal cystic expansion but side-effects can limit its efficacy. To  address the need to identify new biomarkers to monitor progression of ADPKD and  to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Tolvaptan, proteomic analysis was  conducted on defined (40-100nm) urinary exosomes isolated from ADPKD patients  phenotyped and clinically monitored over a 10-year period. Comparative Gene  Ontology analysis of Tandem Mass Tag labelled mass spectrometry-derived protein  profiles from urinary exosomes from ADPKD patients with rapid (>10ml/min/5 years  decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate) versus slow progression showed  distinctive patterns of pathway up-regulation. Clear discrimination between rapid  and slowly-progressive profiles were seen in all stages functional decline in  ADPKD patients whether with mild (>70ml/min), moderate (50-69ml/min) or severe  (<49ml/min) disease at onset. Discriminatory pathways and proteins included  Notch-, integrin- and growth factor-signalling; microtubular kinase, vesicular  proteins and epidermal growth factor substrates. Confocal microscopy of  fluorescently-labelled normal versus ADPKD epithelial cell-derived exosomes in  vitro also identified ADPKD-dependent abnormalities in intracellular vesicular  trafficking and implicated changes in ADPKD-dependent exosome secretion and  target cell uptake as factors underlying urinary exosome excretion biomarker  properties.

We determined the prognostic  performance to identify patients with a fast progressive disease course and  evaluated time-dependent changes in urinary metabolites. METHODS: Targeted,  quantitative metabolomics analysis (1H NMR-spectroscopy) was performed on spot  urinary samples at two time points, baseline (n = 324, 61% female; mean age 45  years, SD 11; median eGFR 61 mL/min/1.73 m2, IQR 42-88; mean years of creatinine  follow-up 3.7, SD 1.3) and a sample obtained after 3 years of follow-up (n =  112). Patients were stratified by their eGFR slope into fast and slow progressors  based on an annualized change of > -3.0 or ≤ -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year,  respectively. Fifty-five urinary metabolites and ratios were quantified, and the  significant ones were selected. Logistic regression was used to determine  prognostic performance in identifying those with a fast progressive course using  baseline urine samples. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze whether  changes in urinary metabolites over a 3-year follow-up period differed between  fast and slow progressors. RESULTS: In a single urinary sample, the prognostic  performance of urinary metabolites was comparable to that of a model including  height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV, AUC = 0.67). Combined with htTKV, the  predictive value of the metabolite model increased (AUC = 0.75). Longitudinal  analyses showed an increase in the myoinositol/citrate ratio (p < 0.001) in fast  progressors, while no significant change was found in those with slow  progression, which is in-line with an overall increase in the myoinositol/citrate  ratio as GFR declines.

However,  human studies investigating the evolution of such phenomena are limited. This  study investigated the levels of emerging biomarkers of endothelial function,  angiogenesis and hypoxia, in ADPKD patients with different renal function.  METHODS: The study population consisted of three groups: 26 ADPKD patients with  impaired renal function (Group A; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]  45-70 mL/min/1.73 m2), 26 ADPKD patients with preserved renal function (Group B;  eGFR >70 mL/min/1.73 m2), and 26 age- and sex-matched controls with no history of  renal disease. Circulating levels of endocan (endothelial cell-specific  molecule-1) angiopoietin-2, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) were  determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. RESULTS: Patients in  Group A had significantly higher levels of endocan (7.17 ± 0.43 ng/mL),  angiopoietin-2 (5,595.43 ± 3,390), and HIF-1a (163.68 ± 37.84 pg/mL) compared to  patients in Group B (6.86 ± 0.59 ng/mL, p = 0.017, 3,854.41 ± 3,014.30, p =  0.018, 136.84 ± 42.10 pg/mL, p = 0.019 respectively) or controls (4.83 ±  0.69 ng/mL, 1,069 ± 427.88 pg/mL, 70.20 ± 17.49 pg/mL, p < 0.001 for all  comparisons). Of note, patients in Group B had also higher levels of all markers  compared to controls (p < 0.001) despite having similar renal function.

Conventional CKD diagnosis relies on estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function derived from serum biomarkers such as serum creatinine (SCr) and cystatin C (SCysC). However, eGFR calculations may be inaccurate when applied to diverse patient populations. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) system that integrates regression-based eGFR estimation, metaheuristic optimization using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and multi-class classification with various ML models to enhance CKD staging and classification. The model estimates eGFR using three established CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations incorporating SCr, SCysC, and their combined values. Regression models assess predictive performance, specifically Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). SVR demonstrates superior performance compared to LR for CKD-EPISCr-SCysC achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.03, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.97%, and a coefficient of determination (R-2) score of 0.97.

Once the model fine-tunes the eGFR estimations, it feeds them into various algorithms for CKD stage classification, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Among these, XGBoost achieves the highest classification accuracy of 97.76%, along with an F1-score of 97.45%, demonstrating its effectiveness in CKD staging.

            We find that 0.05% of the general population has a relevant variant in PKD1 or PKD2 (1/2000 people). In this population-level sample, the prevalence of kidney disease in carriers with hypertension is 71% (74% for PKD1 and 66% for PKD2) compared to 12% for noncarriers with hypertension. For carriers without hypertension, the prevalence is 14% (2% for PKD1 and 30% for PKD2) vs. 1% for noncarriers without hypertension. Importantly, the hypertension diagnosis precedes the kidney disease diagnosis by a mean of 11 years in these carriers. We additionally identify a subset of carriers who are outliers for a set of metabolites that includes cystatin C, creatinine and urea.

PUV is the most frequently reported congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) associated with bladder outlet obstruction in male children. It contributes significantly to the CKD burden in childhood. Despite different approaches for its postnatal repair, evidence-based data still suggest a high risk of CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) later in childhood. In obstructive nephropathy, glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions contribute to renal impairment. Although it may be difficult to predict these adverse renal outcomes in repaired PUV, detecting and monitoring future CKD appears enhanced using the combination of serum creatinine- or cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria. Given the drawbacks of these conventional biomarkers, there is a paradigm shift to novel biomarkers as tools for the early identification of glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions seen in obstructive nephropathy. Most novel biomarkers are yet to be fully applied to routine clinical practice globally. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence showing that they form part of the emerging diagnostics for obstructive nephropathy. From the reviewed studies, urine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is the most prominent biomarker among the novel biomarkers of obstructive nephropathy. However, other novel approaches like the machine learning (ML) model (a form of health-related artificial intelligence) and urodynamic parameters like bladder contractility index hold promise for PUV outcomes prediction (PUVOP). Because of the association of urine TGF-beta 1 with urine angiotensin level (a biomarker of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS]), early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy in patients with PUV may potentially retard the progression of CKD and improve renal outcomes.

Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of DEG were performed. iRegulon was used to construct the miRNA-mRNA network and predict related transcription factors (TFs) associated with ADPKD. The function of miRNA network was explored by analyzing GO and KEGG enrichment. Further, qRT-PCR was performed in vitro to determine the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs associated with ADPKD.

The development of novel biomarkers for kidney disease, especially DN, is becoming a focus of medical research. Serum creatinine and urine albumin measurements had been the gold standards for the diagnosis of DN until the advent of newer markers like Cystatin C, Kidney Injury Molecule-1, etc. Currently, there is no non invasive investigation for the prediction of DN. Nevertheless, the field of proteomics is advancing at a rapid pace, such that urinary proteomic biomarkers have found a spot in the diagnosis of DN.

Cystatin C (CystC), a biomarker of renal function, is well associated with renal impairment in various populations, however, it is underexplored in the South African population of PLWH, as compared to creatinine-based measurements. Creatinine-based measurements for assessing kidney function in people with HIV can be limited due to the influence of muscle wasting, altered creatinine metabolism, and the potential for certain antiretroviral medications to impact creatinine secretion. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the effect of HAART on renal function among PLWH with the use of Cyst C-based measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 111 adults PLWH, 84 on HAART, and 27 on HAART-na & iuml;ve. The cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4 +) count, plasma CystC, as well as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, were determined. In the present study, no significant differences were observed between HAART-treated and HAART-na & iuml;ve groups in terms of plasma CystC and eGFR(CystC). Participants who were on HAART for > 5 years were significantly associated with eGFR(CystC) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), as indicated by substantial odds ratio of 4.39 (confidence interval: 1.60-12.02, p = 0.004) in the unadjusted analysis and even after adjustment for age, sex and smoking status, with odds ratio of 4.10 (confidence interval: 1.41-11.86, p = 0.009). Advanced World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage significantly associated with eGFR(CystC) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) as indicated by odds ratio of 11.73 (confidence interval: 2.27-60.75, p = 0.003) in the unadjusted analysis. Even after adjusting for confounders which included age, sex, and smoking status, the association persisted, with an odds ratio of 16.71 (confidence interval: 2.57-108.75, p = 0.003). In conclusion, CystC and eGFR(CystC) levels were not different between PLWH on HAART and not on HAART but prolonged HAART use for over five years and advanced HIV disease were associated with reduced renal function in this population of PLWH on HAART, as assessed using CystC-based measures. These findings may suggest that HAART had initial beneficial effects and long-term adverse effects. The future risk of progressive eGFR decline may be increased in this HIV population on HAART due to the cumulative effect of prolonged tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) use.
