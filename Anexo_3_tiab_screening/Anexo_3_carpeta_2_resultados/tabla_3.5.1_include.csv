In spite of the recent tremendous progress in the  understanding of ADPKD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms of the disease  remain incompletely understood. Considering emerging new targeted therapies for  ADPKD, it has become crucial to disclose easily measurable and widely available  biomarkers for identifying patients with future rapid disease progression. This  review encompasses all the research with a shared goal of identifying promising  serum or urine biomarkers for predicting ADPKD progression or response to  therapy. The rate of the ADPKD progress varies significantly between patients.  The phenotypic variability is only partly explained by the underlying genetic  lesion diversity. Considering significant decline in kidney function in ADPKD is  not usually evident until at least 50% of the parenchyma has been destroyed,  conventional kidney function measures, such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR),  are not suitable for monitoring disease progression in ADPKD, particularly in its  early stages. Since polycystic kidney enlargement usually precedes the decline in  GFR, height-adjusted total kidney volume (ht-TKV) has been accepted as an early  biomarker for assessing disease severity in ADPKD patients. However, since  measuring ht-TKV is time-consuming and observer-dependent, the identification of  a sensitive and quickly measurable biomarker is of a great interest for everyday  clinical practice. Throughout the last decade, due to development of proteomic  and metabolomic techniques and the enlightenment of multiple molecular pathways  involved in the ADPKD pathogenesis, a number of urine and serum protein  biomarkers have been investigated in ADPKD patients, some of which seem worth of  further exploring. These include copeptin, angiotensinogen, monocyte  chemoattractant protein 1, kidney injury molecule-1 and urine-to-plasma urea  ratio among many others. The aim of the current review is to provide an overview  of all of the published evidence on potentially clinically valuable serum and  urine biomarkers that could be used for predicting disease progression or  response to therapy in patients with ADPKD.

This study  investigated urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) as a source of such  biomarkers. Proteomic analysis of uEVs identified matrix metalloproteinase 7  (MMP-7) as a biomarker predictive of rapid disease progression. In validation  studies, MMP-7 was predictive in uEVs but not in whole urine, possibly because  uEVs are primarily secreted by tubular epithelial cells. Indeed, single-nucleus  RNA sequencing showed that MMP-7 was especially increased in proximal tubule and  thick ascending limb cells, which were further characterized by a profibrotic  phenotype. Together, these data suggest that MMP-7 is a biologically plausible  and promising uEV biomarker for rapid disease progression in ADPKD. BACKGROUND:  In ADPKD, there is an unmet need for early markers of rapid disease progression  to facilitate counseling and selection for kidney-protective therapy. Our aim was  to identify markers for rapid disease progression in uEVs. METHODS: Six paired  case-control groups ( n =10-59/group) of cases with rapid disease progression and  controls with stable disease were formed from two independent ADPKD cohorts, with  matching by age, sex, total kidney volume, and genetic variant. Candidate uEV  biomarkers were identified by mass spectrometry and further analyzed using  immunoblotting and an ELISA. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of healthy and ADPKD  tissue was used to identify the cellular origin of the uEV biomarker. RESULTS: In  the discovery proteomics experiments, the protein abundance of MMP-7 was  significantly higher in uEVs of patients with rapid disease progression compared  with stable disease. In the validation groups, a significant >2-fold increase in  uEV-MMP-7 in patients with rapid disease progression was confirmed using  immunoblotting. By contrast, no significant difference in MMP-7 was found in  whole urine using ELISA. Compared with healthy kidney tissue, ADPKD tissue had  significantly higher MMP-7 expression in proximal tubule and thick ascending limb  cells with a profibrotic phenotype.

Urinary biomarkers may be useful for predicting the variable course of  ADPKD progression from cyst growth to ESRD. METHODS: To identify candidate  urinary biomarkers of ADPKD progression, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to  generate porcine fibroblasts with mono- and biallelic ADPKD gene knockout  (PKD2+/- and PKD2-/-, respectively). We then performed RNA-sequencing analysis on  these cells. RESULTS: Levels of osteopontin (OPN), which is expressed by renal  epithelial tubular cells and excreted into urine, were reduced in PKD2-/- cells  but not in PKD2+/- cells. OPN levels were also reduced in the renal cyst cells of  ADPKD patients. Next, we investigated whether OPN excretion was decreased in  patients with ADPKD via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OPN levels excreted  into renal cyst cell culture media and urine from ADPKD patients were decreased.

However, results at odds were often  noted from such independent association studies. This study proposes a genome  wide analysis approach to predict ESRD risk associated genes. METHODS: We  included 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing association among  north Indian ESRD cases and controls. ESRD cases comprised chronic  glomerulonephritis (CGN), chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN), hypertension  (HTN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Genotyping data  obtained from our prior published reports were compared with Genome-Wide  Association Studies (GWAS) SNPs retrieved from HapMap and GWASCentral databases  using R-statistical package SNPAssoc. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), gene-gene  interaction, classification and regression tree (CART) and pathway analysis were  carried out in the present study supplemented with IL-6 and TNF-α levels  estimation using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Comparison  of genotyping data with GWAS SNPs revealed significant associations for  interleukin (IL)1-RN, IL-6, MTHFR, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and CCR3  genes with ESRD. Nine SNPs were commonly associated with CGN, CIN, HTN, ADPKD and  ESRD. LD (D = 0.9) and gene-gene interaction (P = 0.0002) analyses revealed  significant associations for IL-6 and TNF-α genes. In a consistent manner, CART  analysis and functional analysis servers predict predisposing effects for TNF-α  and IL-6 with ESRD. Finally, higher body circulating levels were observed for  mutant TNF-α and IL-6 alleles among ESRD.

This  presents significant patient anxiety and a significant prognostic and therapeutic  challenge. Tolvaptan is the only approved drug licensed to slow ADPKD progression  by reducing renal cystic expansion but side-effects can limit its efficacy. To  address the need to identify new biomarkers to monitor progression of ADPKD and  to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Tolvaptan, proteomic analysis was  conducted on defined (40-100nm) urinary exosomes isolated from ADPKD patients  phenotyped and clinically monitored over a 10-year period. Comparative Gene  Ontology analysis of Tandem Mass Tag labelled mass spectrometry-derived protein  profiles from urinary exosomes from ADPKD patients with rapid (>10ml/min/5 years  decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate) versus slow progression showed  distinctive patterns of pathway up-regulation. Clear discrimination between rapid  and slowly-progressive profiles were seen in all stages functional decline in  ADPKD patients whether with mild (>70ml/min), moderate (50-69ml/min) or severe  (<49ml/min) disease at onset. Discriminatory pathways and proteins included  Notch-, integrin- and growth factor-signalling; microtubular kinase, vesicular  proteins and epidermal growth factor substrates. Confocal microscopy of  fluorescently-labelled normal versus ADPKD epithelial cell-derived exosomes in  vitro also identified ADPKD-dependent abnormalities in intracellular vesicular  trafficking and implicated changes in ADPKD-dependent exosome secretion and  target cell uptake as factors underlying urinary exosome excretion biomarker  properties. Comparative proteomic analysis of urinary exosomal proteins in  individual patients before and after treatment with Tolvaptan for 4 years also  identified distinct patterns of pathway modification dependent on the degree of  effectiveness of the therapeutic response. Up-regulation of Wnt-pathway and  vesicular proteins were characteristic of urinary exosomes from ADPKD patients  with good responses to Tolvaptan while upregulation of angiogenesis pathways and  additional molecular forms of vasopressin receptor AVPR2 were characteristic in  urinary exosomes of ADPKD patients with poor responses.

Conventional markers all have their limitations. Metabolic profiling is a  promising strategy for risk stratification. We determined the prognostic  performance to identify patients with a fast progressive disease course and  evaluated time-dependent changes in urinary metabolites. METHODS: Targeted,  quantitative metabolomics analysis (1H NMR-spectroscopy) was performed on spot  urinary samples at two time points, baseline (n = 324, 61% female; mean age 45  years, SD 11; median eGFR 61 mL/min/1.73 m2, IQR 42-88; mean years of creatinine  follow-up 3.7, SD 1.3) and a sample obtained after 3 years of follow-up (n =  112). Patients were stratified by their eGFR slope into fast and slow progressors  based on an annualized change of > -3.0 or ≤ -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year,  respectively. Fifty-five urinary metabolites and ratios were quantified, and the  significant ones were selected. Logistic regression was used to determine  prognostic performance in identifying those with a fast progressive course using  baseline urine samples. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to analyze whether  changes in urinary metabolites over a 3-year follow-up period differed between  fast and slow progressors. RESULTS: In a single urinary sample, the prognostic  performance of urinary metabolites was comparable to that of a model including  height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV, AUC = 0.67). Combined with htTKV, the  predictive value of the metabolite model increased (AUC = 0.75). Longitudinal  analyses showed an increase in the myoinositol/citrate ratio (p < 0.001) in fast  progressors, while no significant change was found in those with slow  progression, which is in-line with an overall increase in the myoinositol/citrate  ratio as GFR declines.

In this investigation, we leveraged a bidirectional Mendelian randomization(MR) analysis, utilizing data from comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to systematically explore the causal relationships between serum and urine biomarkers and PKD onset. Instrumental variable selection adhered to stringent criteria to ensure methodological rigor and robust causal inference. Our primary analytical method, inverse variance weighted (IVW), was complemented by MR-Egger, Weighted Median, and Weighted Mode sensitivity analyses to account for pleiotropy and other biases. Heterogeneity was tested using the Cochrane Q statistic, while horizontal pleiotropy was probed via the MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO global test. Sensitivity to instrument selection was evaluated with a Leave-one-out analysis. The MR analysis identified two serum biomarkers-Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)-as exhibiting statistically significant causal associations with PKD risk. However, reverse MR analysis revealed no significant feedback effect of PKD genetic liability on these biomarker levels. These findings highlight GGT and SHBG as potential biomarkers for early PKD detection, offering novel insights into its pathobiological underpinnings and informing future therapeutic target development.",2024-12-31,2025-07-29 13:46:57,2025-07-29 13:46:57,2024-12-16,,,1,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001374129200001,,,Tongling Hosp Tradit Chinese Med,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35 blood and urine biomarkers in polycystic kidney disease: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study polycystic kidney disease (pkd), a highly prevalent hereditary condition, presents significant gaps in understanding its early-stage pathophysiology and lacks reliable biomarkers to capture these early mechanistic changes. in this investigation, we leveraged a bidirectional mendelian randomization(mr) analysis, utilizing data from comprehensive genome-wide association studies (gwas) to systematically explore the causal relationships between serum and urine biomarkers and pkd onset. instrumental variable selection adhered to stringent criteria to ensure methodological rigor and robust causal inference. our primary analytical method, inverse variance weighted (ivw), was complemented by mr-egger, weighted median, and weighted mode sensitivity analyses to account for pleiotropy and other biases. heterogeneity was tested using the cochrane q statistic, while horizontal pleiotropy was probed via the mr-egger intercept test and mr-presso global test. sensitivity to instrument selection was evaluated with a leave-one-out analysis. the mr analysis identified two serum biomarkers-gamma-glutamyl transferase (ggt) and sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg)-as exhibiting statistically significant causal associations with pkd risk. however, reverse mr analysis revealed no significant feedback effect of pkd genetic liability on these biomarker levels. these findings highlight ggt and shbg as potential biomarkers for early pkd detection, offering novel insights into its pathobiological underpinnings and informing future therapeutic target development.",,True,True,True,True,True,"GWAS, serum and urine biomarkers",y,include,,

In this study, an analysis of miRNA-mRNA networks was conducted to identify miRNAs linked Omnibus (GEO) database were obtained to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) in the progression of ADPKD. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of DEG were performed. iRegulon was used to construct the miRNA-mRNA network and predict related transcription factors (TFs) associated with ADPKD. The function of miRNA network was explored by analyzing GO and KEGG enrichment. Further, qRT-PCR was performed in vitro to determine the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs associated with ADPKD. In the results, 2 DEMs and 1090 DEGs were identified. While DEGs that were downregulated tended to be enriched for metabolic pathways, DEGs that were upregulated tended to be enriched for beta-alanine metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. The miRNA-mRNA network consisted of 2 miRNAs (miR-199a-3p and miR-107) and 7 mRNAs. It appears that miRNAs may positively regulate fibroblast migration, calcium signaling, and cell division based on GO and KEGG analysis. What's more, by detecting the expression of the key ADPKDrelated miRNA-mRNA in vitro experiments, two miRNAs (miR-199a-3p, miR-107) and four candidate RUNX1 Partner Transcriptional Co-Repressor 1, RUNX1T1; and Fibroblast growth factor 2, FGF2) were identified.
